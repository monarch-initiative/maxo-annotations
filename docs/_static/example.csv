Comment,Fluoxetine is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that also has been found to decrease channel-opening duration and in this study is used off-label for patients with slow-channel CMS. ,Fluoxetine use in patients with fast-channel CMS, in whom channel-opening duration is already too short, causes worsening of symptoms.
